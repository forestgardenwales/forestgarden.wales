The [Alberto’s Locoto](http://www.realseeds.co.uk/hotpeppers.html) chilli peppers are almost #ForestGarden, I’ve been growing them as perennials in pots, bringing them into the conservatory for winter. This year, I planted them out in the polytunnel, fantastic harvest, and I’ll attempt to cut them right back before the first frost and mulch them with a thick layer of dry wood shavings. Hopefully that will be enough insulation to keep them alive. But ow, even with gloves on I managed to make my fingers burn after slicing them up for the freezer.
