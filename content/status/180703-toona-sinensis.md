Had our first taste of [Toona sinensis](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Toona+sinensis) (Chinese Cedar) from the #ForestGarden yesterday, in a stir-fry with broccoli and onions. One for [@BackyardLarder](https://twitter.com/BackyardLarder) 🙂. Really, really nice taste, strong and garlicky with a complex mustiness. Some of the older leaves were a bit tough, pick just the shoots if you can.
