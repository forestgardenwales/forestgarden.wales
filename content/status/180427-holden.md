Very good to hear Patrick Holden from [@SusFoodTrust](https://twitter.com/SusFoodTrust) on [@BBCr4today](https://twitter.com/@BBCr4today) [this morning](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09zt3qn) with Tom Bradshaw [@ProagriLtd](https://twitter.com/@ProagriLtd) – opportunity to “reintegrate food production with nature preservation” and take a good look at nitrate use in agriculture.
