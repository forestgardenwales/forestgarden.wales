Had a very successful #ForestGarden tour yesterday with five people. The [introduction talk is online](https://www.forestgarden.wales/talks/intro/#1), as is the ever-popular [vegan chocolate brownie recipe](http://simp.ly/publish/L624C8)! Next public tour for individuals is Saturday 7th July [forestgardenwales.eventbrite.co.uk](https://forestgardenwales.eventbrite.co.uk/), contact me directly for group tours 🙂
