Interesting campaign by [@ecotricity](https://twitter.com/ecotricity) to emphasise that they supply **vegan electricity**. As a vegetarian, I never knew that animal by-products made up 1% of electricity generation, see [Is your energy supply vegan?](https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/our-green-energy/vegan-energy-supply) for more info.
