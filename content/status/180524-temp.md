The mustard is in flower ([Sinapis alba](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Sinapis+alba), brilliant yellow flower, really strongly scented. It’s a temporary ground cover in the #ForestGarden, used to allow the perennial ground cover to establish (on the Blue Bean Border, we’ve planted [Rubus nepalensis](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=rubus+nepalensis), [Glechomae hederacea](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Glechoma+hederacea) and [Vinca minor](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Vinca+minor)).

Why _is_ the periwinkle called The Flower of Death?!?!
