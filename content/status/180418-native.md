Excellent fact sheet from [Linda Chalker-Scott](https://puyallup.wsu.edu/lcs/) ([@LindaCS](https://twitter.com/LindaCS)) about that old chestnut, native vs non-native for biodiversity:

[Are native trees and shrubs better choices for wildlife in home landscapes?](http://cru.cahe.wsu.edu/CEPublications/FS300E/FS300E.pdf) (PDF)

Under **Action Items for Gardeners**, the advice is pretty much “grow a forest garden”!!

TL;DR "the native status of trees and shrubs had no impact on wildlife biodiversity"
