We’ve taken the plunge and opened up the [forest garden tours](/tours/) for individual members of the public to come along, rather than just taking group bookings.

First Saturday of the month, May to September inclusive, here are those dates in full:

* Saturday 5th May
* Saturday 2nd June
* Saturday 7th July
* Saturday 4th August
* Saturday 1st September

Please book in advance, tickets from [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/forest-garden-wales-tour-tickets-45399231323), £10 each.

This is a bit risky, as in we’re not expecting vast numbers of people (the first Saturday is coming up already!) **but** it is an opportunity to spread the word about forest gardening, and all the benefits. If you’re not sure what those benefits are, I will put them into buillet points for you:

1. **Less maintenance**. No, really, **less maintenance**. A forest garden isn’t a miracle cure but by the very design (perennials, ground cover, self-fertilising) they are **less maintenance**. Doesn’t that sound attractive?
2. **Less grass**. This is actually the same as above. But, there is generally less grass in a forest garden, just some paths. And less grass means… **less mowing**. That’s right, even _less_ maintenance. 
3. **More wildlife**. Everybody likes wildlife. Wildlife likes wildlife, particularly for lunch. And forest gardens are, by nature, wildlife-friendly. There’s a great diversity of permanent cover and plant species, in different layers (trees, shrubs, ground cover). And diversity encourages wildlife.
4. **Stuff you can eat**. It’s like foraging in your own back garden, without having to ask the landowner’s permission (because you are the landowner).
5. **Stuff you can use**. Things like wood, poles, twine, dyes, herbals…

Do come along if you’re in West Wales, and I’ll expound upon these bullet points for at least 3 hours. Whilst walking. Here’s a link to the tickets again:
