I [gave a talk](http://localhost:1313/talks/magic/#1) recently to a [local gardening club](http://www.drefachfelindregardeningclub.co.uk/) and I wanted to highlight the benefits of a forest garden in an accessible way (if you didn’t know, a forest garden is a productive way to garden using trees, shrubs and perennial plants). So here are my top 7 magical things that you may find hard to believe:

1. **Zero watering**: No, really. If you have an established forest garden, you don’t have to water it. Obviously, your seedlings, annual veg and pots will still need that watering can <abbr title="Tender Loving Care">TLC</abbr>.
2. **Minimal mowing**: There are no lawns in a forest garden (unless you want one!!), which only leaves grass paths. For larger areas of grass, create your own mini-meadow, mow paths through them and bring out the scythe once or twice a year.
3. **Occasional weeding**: Everything is mulched in a forest garden, whether with ground cover plants, temporary green manures or “cut ‘n’ drop” comfrey. Weeds find it very hard to get established.
4. **No dig**: The soil in a forest garden is _always_ covered and mineral accumulators like comfrey are incorporated into the design, and with the vast majority of plants being perennial, the underground network of [mycorrhizal fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza) has a chance to get established. Apart from the initial planting, there is next to no digging (though it won’t feel like it after you’ve planted a hundred bare-root whips for your windbreak…)
5. **No chemicals**: The aim of a forest garden is to **work with nature**, which means creating a _healthy balance_ in the garden. By encouraging predators, pollinators and a healthy soil, there really isn’t any need for chemicals.
6. **Wildlife haven**: With no chemicals, in-situ composting and a multi-layered use of the garden space, wildlife has a home and a food supply, all the way up to the top of the chain.
7. **Abundant produce!**: A forest garden is a **productive space**. It’s like an orchard, combined with a perennial vegetable patch, mixed with a wildlife garden. Nuts, fruit, seeds, salad, green veg, shoots, twine, fungi… there’s an awful lot you can grow.

Above and encompassing all these things, a forest garden, like every garden, is a properly magical space just to be.
