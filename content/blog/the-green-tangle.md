As the saying goes, “You can have a show garden _or_ you can have a real garden”. Forest gardens definitely fall into the latter category, they’re first and foremost a productive and practical garden system. 

The Fruit Triangle at Forest Garden Wales (so called because it’s a triangle and there’s, er, lots of fruit) honestly is a bit of a green tangle. **But** there is a beauty and diversity even in this relatively small space.

This post itself is a bit of a ramble, as I will unpick the green tangle plant by plant.

Do remember, **flowers are allowed**, nay, _encouraged_. Often edible and pollinator friendly, they also jolly the place up, and lest we forget [gardens are for people](https://mobile.twitter.com/ForestGdnWales/status/1008341790204841984). The more you enjoy a space, the more you want to be in that space, the more you will care for that space.

So, first and in the foreground, I give you the glorious mallow:

{{< figure src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/900/28929400768_c090ebd3ef_z_d.jpg" alt="Photo of common Mallow in front of Japanese quince and with strawberry ground cover" caption="Malva sylvestris (common mallow)" >}}

You have a choice of many different species and varieties of mallow (have a look on [PFAF](https://www.pfaf.org/)), you can eat them raw and cooked, and they can thicken up sauces. And even _I_ can grow them from seed.

There’s a lot going on the ground as well. One of my many mottos is “Mulch Everything”. We’ve used [bulk bought bark](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/unglamorous-grunt-work/) as a mulch but in the future, we’ll be using a [wood chipper](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=wood+chipper+domestic&t=ffab&iax=images&ia=images) on hedge cuttings and the willow coppice to create [wood chip mulch](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/does-woodchip-mulch-rob-nitrogen-from-the-soil/).

The living ground cover we’ve planted is [Fragaria chiloensis](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Fragaria+chiloensis) (Chilean Strawberry), interspersed with some [Glechomae hederacea](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Glechoma+hederacea) (Alefoot).

{{< figure src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1732/27934422947_bc04e1bc5b_z_d.jpg" alt="Strawberry leaves" caption="Fragaria chiloensis (Chilean strawberry) ground cover" >}}

To allow the permanent ground cover a chance to get established, we’ve sown [agriculturally sourced](https://www.cotswoldseeds.com/product/mustard-sinapis-alba) [Sinapis alba](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Sinapis+alba) (White Mustard). This will die back after the summer, by which time the strawberries will be in full strawberry swing.

{{< figure src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/883/27934383627_d5877f38e9_z_d.jpg" alt="Yellow flowers and green foliage of the white mustard" caption="Alba sinapis (white mustard) temporary ground cover, in flower" >}} 

Now, onto the fruit. And what a lot of fruit there is. Everybody loves raspberries (apart from those of us who don’t). These are summer raspberries ([Rubus idaeus](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Rubus+idaeus)) that have been rescued from a path restoration project, so no idea what variety.

{{< figure src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1729/42085781854_19233ab995_z_d.jpg" alt="One ripe raspberry on a raspberry plant, with yellow flowers in the backgroudn" caption="A rescued early Rubus idaeus (raspberry)" >}}

Likewise, the blackcurrants ([Ribes nigrum](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ribes+nigrum)) have been rescued from another part of the garden, I _think_ that they’re 'Ben Nevis'. 

{{< figure src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1721/42085503664_eda8038c32_z_d.jpg" alt="Top of blackcurrant, grass on left background, yellow flowered mustard on right" caption="Ribes nigrum 'Ben Nevis' (blackcurrant)" >}}

And another garden rescuee is the gooseberry ([Ribes uva-crispa](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ribes+uva-crispa))I found growing at right-angles from the hedge. I’m not overly concerned if it fruits or not, as it has a plucky survival story all of its own. 

{{< figure src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/883/28929735338_de52163403_z_d.jpg" alt="Barely visible wonky gooseberry in amongst green foliage" caption="A rescued Ribes uva-crispa (gooseberry), a bit wonky from a few years growing in a hedge" >}}

Now I realise that about 50% of our plants have been rescued, recycled or donated. Another one is the Japanese Raspberry ([Rubus phoenicolasius](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rubus+phoenicolasius)) from a neighbour.

{{< figure src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1784/42144298604_12b59d3d3b_z_d.jpg" alt="Jumble of wineberry leaves in amongst the green garden" caption="Rubus phoenicolasius (Japanese wineberry)" >}}

The semi-dwarf apple tree ([Malus domestica](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Malus+domestica)) has been rescued from where the summer house has been built, it’s a ['Braeburn'](https://www.orangepippin.com/apples/braeburn) on an [M26](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/rootstock-reference/) rootsock.

{{< figure src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/899/42813717192_0e7e478684_z_d.jpg" alt="Small apple tree, comfrey in front, grass path and gate behind" caption="Malus domestica 'Braeburn' (apple) on M26 rootstock" >}}

The last two items of fruit are the blueberry 'Gold Traube' ([Vaccinium corymbosum](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Vaccinium+corymbosum))

{{< figure src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1749/28989373678_d691906560_z_d.jpg" alt="Blueberry" caption="Vaccinium corymbosum (Gold Traube)" >}}

Finally, the Japanese Qunice 'Nivalis', a scraggy plant if ever there was.

{{< figure src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/876/42813755632_1aee335f49_z_d.jpg" alt="Scraggy Japanese quince, lots of leaves" caption="Chaenomeles japonica 'Nivalis' (Japanese quince)" >}}

To feed all this, we have plentiful outcrops of comfrey ([Symphytum officinale 'Bocking 14'](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Symphytum+officinale)), which are cut back a couple of times a year and laid directly under the fruit bushes to compost down.

{{< figure src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1750/42813664482_df19a88132_z_d.jpg" alt="Comfrey big pointy leaves" caption="Symphytum officinale 'Bocking 14'" >}}

I hope you enjoyed the untangling of The Green Tangle. I do have plans for an Ornamental Maintenance-free Forest Garden, which will use the #ForestGarden palette for aesthetic effect. But that’s for another blog post 🙂.
