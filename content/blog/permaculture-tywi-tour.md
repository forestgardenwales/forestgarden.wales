[Permaculture Tywi](https://twitter.com/permatywi) from Llandeilo way (the [Tywi Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Tywi)) came for a #ForestGarden tour last Saturday. It formed part of their [Permaculture Design Course](https://www.permaculture.co.uk/courses), so I created a bespoke [Introduction to Forest Gardening](https://www.forestgarden.wales/talks/tywi/) talk for them. Of course, I spelt Tywi wrong! On the plus side, the course leader Paul Jennings told us about the [straight tusked elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-tusked_elephant) and the pivotal role it used played in the ecology. So, my not-haiku became:

> Gently balance the garden 
> On the cusp of woodland 
> With minimal elephant

The talk went down well I think, although I do try to squeeze everything in to an hour, so it inevitably bursts the seams of time and spills into an hour and a half. Luckily, people had fuelled up on the famous [vegan chocolate brownies](http://simp.ly/publish/L624C8) (pictured).

One of the great things with talking about what you’ve learned is that you receive more ideas and inspirations in return. One chap mentioned non-woven geotextile mulch as an alternative to woven sheet mulch, Paul Jennings talked about cut and drop mulching, Chris used to be a garden designer and has inspired me to find out more about surveying methods and CAD. 

It’s a privilege to share knowledge with such an interesting and engaged group of invdividuals 🙂.
