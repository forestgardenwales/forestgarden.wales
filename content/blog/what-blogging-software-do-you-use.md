My alter ego is [a web designer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-rayson-designer/). This is a blessing and a curse, for I have spent **too long** building the new [Forest Garden Wales website blog](https://www.forestgarden.wales) and not enought time gardening. I ended up using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a rather nifty [static site generator](http://www.staticgen.com/) and a [geekyish alternative](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/05/18/9-reasons-your-site-should-be-static/) to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). 

Would I have been better off using off-the-shelf blogging software? I really don’t know, which is why I’m keen to find out what other people are using – [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/uk), [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/), self-hosted WordPress? And are people able to promote their posts on different social media? I know you can use [JetPack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) and [SNAP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-networks-auto-poster-facebook-twitter-g/) for WordPress but I’ve no real idea about other platforms.

The main reason for building my own blog is because I want to **speed up** and **secure** my garden blogging and social media workflow whilst retaining control over my content (oh, and because I can 😜). Hopefully, this very blog post will be automatically published to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ForestGdnWales), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Forest-Garden-Wales), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/111290684473488016210), [WordPress](forestgardenwales.wordpress.com) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/forest-garden-wales/). At the same time, the content will **always** be available on this site.

I think this control of your own work is a big issue, particularly in the light of recent Facebook revelations about their business model (which applies equally to Google et al). Combined with [tracker](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) [blockers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en), it’s time to take your privacy back!

There’s still an awful lot left to do this website (self-hosted photos rather than using [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/), a [nice User Interface](https://www.netlifycms.org/), [comments](https://staticman.net/), [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/webmention) etc.)
but hopefully I can share some of the lessons I’ve learned with other garden bloggers 😄.
