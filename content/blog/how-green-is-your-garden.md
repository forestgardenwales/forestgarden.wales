I came across a post about how to [Capture carbon in your garden](https://modernmint.co.uk/capture-carbon/), by [@ModernMintLtd](https://twitter.com/ModernMintLtd/). Really simple, and not surprisingly, forest gardening ticks all the boxes.

1. Plant a tree  
  ✔️&nbsp;&nbsp;_Part of the very definition of a forest garden!_
2. Improve your soil (mulch, don’t dig)  
  ️✔️&nbsp;&nbsp;_Use a living mulch, ie ground cover plants_
3. Cover your soil with plants  
  ✔️️&nbsp;&nbsp;_See above!_
4. Don’t use artificial fertiliser  
  ️✔️&nbsp;&nbsp;_Use mineral accumulators & nitrogren fixers for nutrients_
5. Use peat free compost  
  ️✔️&nbsp;&nbsp;_Very little compost used, only peat-free potting compost for seedlings_

There were some ideas contributed by other people, and again, this is what we’re moving toward:

## Contributed ideas

* No petrol based tools
* Grow from seed at home
* Grow as much food as you can
* Reduce your lawn
* Don’t heat your greenhouse

We are still using a petrol mower to keep the grass paths short on an acre field. Currently, it’s about 2 hours a week mowing but we’re constantly reducing the amount of grass that has to be cut. Also, it’s taking a while to shift our diet to home grown food, which is as much about knowledge of cooking and plants as it is about a desire to change. This is the third year of the forest garden, and it’s the first time we’ve really noticed an increase in the produce.
