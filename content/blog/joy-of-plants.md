On a visit to [Penrallt Garden Centre](http://penralltnursery.co.uk) last year, I was trying to track down [Mentha longifolia](http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=mentha+longifolia) (horse mint) after seeing it used as a rampant ground cover on Martin Crawford’s [forest gardening course](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/forest-gardening-food-forests-design-course/). The staff member pulled out her iPhone and looked it up for me, on a very handy app called [Joy of Plants](https://joyofplants.com/iphone.php).

I installed it on my phone, and now use it most weeks; it’s really good for detailed information and photographs of specific varieties, and covers a lot of forest garden favourites as well. In combination with [Plants for a Future](http://www.pfaf.org/user/Default.aspx), a superb resource for forest gardening, all my plant database needs are pretty much met 🙂

What I do find strange though is that, despite the vast and detailed amount of work that has obviously gone in to [Joy of Plants](https://joyofplants.com/), it’s not that widely publicised in the ”gardening social circles” which I’ve started researching. My guess is that the work is one thing, the networking another – all the more reason to join in with groups like [Garden Bloggers #gdnbloggers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gdnbloggers/) to help spread the word of good work.
