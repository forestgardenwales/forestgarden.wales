We picked our first ever gooseberries last week. I washed them, popped them into a saucepan with a tiny bit of water, cooked them on a low heat for a few minutes until soft then added some sugar. I then put this on the top of banana cake just before it went in the oven.

## Ingredients

* 3 bananas (ripe)
* 75g coconut oil (melted or at least softened)
* 140g cane sugar (Pure, Date, Palm or Coconut are fine, too)
* 80g almond milk
* 1 tbsp pure vanilla extract
* 1 flax egg (1 tbsp ground flax seed dissolved in water)
* ½ tsp baking soda
* 1½ tsp baking powder
* 2 tsp cinnamon
* pinch sea salt
* 240g whole wheat flour 

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 180°C. 
2. Mix flax seed with 3 tbsp water and set aside. 
3. In a medium bowl, use a fork to mash the bananas with coconut oil and sugar, mix well.
4. Add flaxseeds, vanilla and milk, mix well. 
5. In a separate bowl, combine dry ingredients. 
6. Add the dry mix to the wet and stir until just combined, do not over mix. Pour batter into tin.
7. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick can be inserted and removed cleanly.
