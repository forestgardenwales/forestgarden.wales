The stinging nettle [Urtica dioica](https://pfaf.org/User/plant.aspx?LatinName=Urtica+dioica) is an excellent forest garden plant. Before it flowers*, it makes a [fantastic soup](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/nettle-soup/), an excellent if strong-tasting spinach replacement, it makes [a nice beer](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/may/18/homebrew-from-the-hedgerow), it contains [buckets of iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urtica_dioica#Food), oodles of [nitrogen](https://www.gardenersworld.com/how-to/maintain-the-garden/how-to-make-a-nettle-feed/), it can be used as a nutritious [chop ‘n’ drop](https://www.gardenmyths.com/composting-the-cut-and-drop-method/) mulching material or made into a fertiliser tea, it’s the [main food for many butterflies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urtica_dioica#Ecology) and a host of [other wildlife](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/wildflowers/stinging-nettle), it’s easy to grow.

In short, what’s not to love? 😍

Oh. The sting. I always sting myself when collecting stinging nettles, no matter how long my gloves.

If it weren’t for the sting, we’d all be growing it [intentionally] in our gardens.

I had heard of a stinging-less sub-species, and thanks to the workings of the wonderful web, [Wicken Fen National Trust Reserve](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wicken-fen-nature-reserve) confirmed its very real existence in a tweet [@WickenFenNT](https://mobile.twitter.com/WickenFenNT/status/1015335041692585984). It’s scientific name is Urtica dioica subsp. galeopsifolia and a common name is Fen Nettle, and I also found it on the [iSpot nature website](https://www.ispotnature.org/communities/uk-and-ireland/view/observation/541738/wicken-fen-4).

Also, perennial vegetable suppliers [Backyard Larder](https://backyardlarder.co.uk) said that they’re [planning a trip](https://mobile.twitter.com/BackyardLarder/status/1017793141003423744) to Wicken Fen and will ask about seed. 

I am very excited about the prospect of a stinging-less nettle bed, effortless spring soups and nutritious summer mulching and I’m sure you should be able to treat as a cut-again crop.

<small>*After it has flowered, apparently there is a build up in gritty particles called cysoliths, which can damage the kidneys if ingested.</small>
