I’m a big fan of Martin Crawford and all he has done to promote the understanding and practise of forest gardening. But as it is forest _gardening_, there are obviously some opinions that are debatable, and woodchip as a mulch around living plants is one of them. He states:

> Woodchip causes a nitrogen deficiency if used as a mulch around living plants

_pp306, [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/)_

I went to visit a chap called Stefan Cartwright who lives locally and who’s planting up a large site with coppice and a forest garden. He swears by woodchip mulch, and showed me some used on a willow coppicing area, with healthy plants and rich, worm-filled soil underneath. 

So, I did some research on that there internet, and I found [Linda Chalker-Scott](http://www.sustainablelandscapesandgardens.com)’s excellent work on [busting horticultural myths](https://puyallup.wsu.edu/lcs/) over at Washington State University. I love a good evidence-based opinion. In an article entitled [“Wood chip mulch: Landscape boon or bane?”](https://puyallup.wsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/403/2015/03/wood-chips.pdf) in the 2007 issue of Master Gardener magazine, she states:

> **Concern:** Wood chip mulches will tie up nitrogen and cause deficiencies in plants.  
> **Evidence:** Actually, many studies have demonstrated that woody mulch materials increase nutrient levels in soils and/or associated plant foliage. 

So, it’s fine to use woodchip as a mulch around living plants, although she advises against using it in annual beds where the plants have very shallow and limited root systems.

This opens up a lot more possibilities, as I would imagine arborist wood chip is far more readily available than bark. Also, we have a **lot** of woody material from hedges and general gardening, and it’s far more efficient (and cheaper!) to chip this on-site than to bring in material from outside. 

This also means that I’ll have more mulching material available so that I can re-use the 1 metre plastic sheet mulch in the coppice and replace it with woodchip. Everyone’s a winner 🙂.
