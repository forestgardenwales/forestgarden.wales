The idea of a blank canvas fills me with an odd sense of dread. Yes, there’s hope and the new and the unexplored. But there is also the weight of expectation. I have a couple of hundred square metres of bare earth out there waiting for me to get planting. The pressure is on.

Which is why I’ve decided to start a new trend called **Garden Design On a Whim**. Essentially, you take a group of plants that you want and organise them by some arbitary measure. I have chosen prickliness. Other people choose the colour white.

The new area to fill the blank canvas is called **Prickly Quad**. It will have prickly plants in it. Already, I have planted a [Crataegus ellwangeriana](http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Crataegus+ellwangeriana) (scarlet hawthorn) and a [Zanthoxylum simulans](http://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Zanthoxylum+simulans) (Szechuan pepper). So, it is only natural to keep on the prickly tip and plant a [Berberis darwinii](http://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Berberis+darwinii) (Darwin’s barberry), a spikey scattering of [Mahonia aquifolium](http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Mahonia+aquifolium) (Oregon grape) and to crown it all, a [Ribes uva-crispa](http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ribes+uva-crispa) (gooseberry) 'Hinnonmaki Red'. For some strange reason, I ❤️ gooseberries.

But. I have reached the end of the prickly forest garden road. I wanted a [Viburnum trilobum](http://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Viburnum+trilobum) (American cranberry) and _it isn’t prickly_. And my mind is now blank on the prickle front. Time to dip in to another whimsical theme… 🙂
