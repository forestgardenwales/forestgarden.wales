With my [web designer/developer](https://www.growdigital.org/) hat on, I built the Forest Garden Wales website using an amazing [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with my own socially-aware starter theme called [Indiego](https://www.indiego.org.uk/). Static site generators simply(sic) generate static pages without the complexity of a database. The plus points are speed, simplicity and price (for more advantages, [see this Netlify article](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/05/18/9-reasons-your-site-should-be-static/)).

The downside is that they can be daunting for a non-developer, with lots of editing text and terminals. The good folk at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) have made a lovely User Interface called [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) that eases the workflow for non-developer people. 

I would like to see a similar User Interface for the installation process, so that setting up a new website is as easy as [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/).

If you’d like to dig around the source code for forestgarden.wales, it’s available on GitHub: [github.com/forestgardenwales/forestgarden.wales](https://github.com/forestgardenwales/forestgarden.wales)

A big thank you to Netlify for such a cool tool 👍 😄
