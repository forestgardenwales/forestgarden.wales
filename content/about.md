# About us

We are deeply committed to forest gardening as a way of improving our environment, food, health and well-being.

A forest garden is a low maintenance, low energy system of cultivation that mimics the layers of a natural forest. It is based on trees, shrubs and perennial plants.

The benefits derived from a forest garden include:

* Food
* Fire wood
* Building materials
* Pollinator friendly flowers
* Soil fertility

We started our own forest garden 3 years ago when we moved to West Wales and want to share our experience and passion.

## Expertise

As relative newcomers to forest gardening, we are lucky to able to draw on the expertise of local arboculturist James Archer and garden designer Angela Siminson.
