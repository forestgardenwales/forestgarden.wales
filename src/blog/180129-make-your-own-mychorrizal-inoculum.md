## Introduction

Time: 3 months

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) 80%

> AMF form symbioses with 80% of plant species, including the majority of herbaceous and annual species, most arid and semi-arid woody species and tropical hardwoods.

> The other main type is the Ectomycorrhizal fungi: these colonize the roots of most temperate and boreal tree species – conifers, oaks, beech etc

> A few plant families do not form mycorrhizas, notably the cabbage and beet families. (The main non-mycorrhizal plant families are: Brassicaceae, Amaranthaceae, Caryophyllaceae and Chenopodiaceae (normally)).

## 1. Collect starter soil

> In temperate regions, hedgerows, thickets and thriving perennial grasslands that have not been cultivated recently are good sources. If you plan to use the inoculum with tree seedlings, there can be special benefit in collecting some of the starter soil from under healthy trees of the same species.

> Method: Clear away about half square metre of the vegetation underneath your target plant. Dig down to a depth of about 25cm collecting the soil and as many fine roots as possible. It is better, but not essential, to collect from under several different trees and shrubs. With stony soil, sieve it to get rid of large stones.

## 2. Multiply mycorrhiza

## 3. Maintain pots

## 4. Harvest

## 5. Using inoculant

### 5.1 Trees from seed
