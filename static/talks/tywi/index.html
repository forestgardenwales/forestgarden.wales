* Working with nature. Pretty much sums it up.
* [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/): buy this book
* Read it cover to cover in a terraced house with a paved yard for 3 years.

# Pt. I: What is a forest garden?

> Forest gardening is a productive & practical garden system using trees, shrubs & perennial plants, designed to be stable,
sustainable & low-maintenance.

## Features

* Multi-layered space
* Diverse harvests 🌰 🍏 🍐 🥝 🍇 🍒
* Large number of species
* Nitrogen fixers & mineral accumulators
* Attract predators & pollinators 🐞 🐝 🦋

???

* Productive. Practical. Low-maintenance. No nonsense.
* Harvest is varied.
* Garden _system_ is the whole system.
* Traditional agricultural science can’t cope with complexity of forest garden, 100+ species of plants.
* History. Robert Hart, Much Wenlock, Shropshire. Other countries.
* My example of resilience and diversity, with north face hedge

# Multi-layered space

# Forest garden harvest

Where you start is what you want.

<div style="float:left">
* Fruits, nuts & seeds
* Vegetables & salad
* Herbs & spices
* Firewood
* Mushrooms
* Poles, canes & twine
* A beautiful space

* Energy
* Fragility
* Uniformity
* Maintenance
* Greenhouse gas emissions

* The further right you go, the more you need.
* Frederic Clements coined the term in 1916.

# Scientifically efficient 👩‍🔬

Efficiency is the ratio of the _input_ to the output.

```html
    Animal          1 :  0.8

    Arable          1 :  4.0

    Forest Garden¹  1 : 40.0
```

* Proviso: once established
* Perennial plants are less work
* No compost bins, compost in situ

Forest gardening also flexible, any size or part of garden.

# Many ways to be productive

* **Strawberry:** ground cover, bee plant, fruit crop
* **Comfrey:** bee plant, ground cover, mineral accumulator, mulch
* **Sea Buckthorn:** fruit, nitrogen fixer, windbreak, animal barrier
* **Orchard ‘meadow’:** habitat, ground cover, mulch material
* **Chickens:** eggs, compost, friends for Ron the dog

> If you make your space beautiful, you will want to spend time there

_Considerations:_

# Propagation bed

![Raised bed made of railway sleepers](img/bed.jpg)

???

* Raised bed at Forest Garden Wales

---

# 5. Sheet mulch

* Quality plastic woven sheet mulch, 3-4m wide
* Re-usable metal pegs
* **Weigh it down!**
* 6 months grass, 12 months dandelions
* Use less more efficiently!

![Woven plastic sheet mulch weighed down with wood](img/sheetmulch.jpg)

???

* Compare Orchard meadow area and Farside
* Decent make, (Mypex, others??)

---

# Chalk circles

![Photo of circles of lime powder around tree and shrub markers](img/limecircles.jpg)

???

* Use [magic bamboo marker](https://www.flickr.com/photos/forestgardenwales/28391494269/in/photolist-KfRQ6T) with string, tied with knots every 0.5m
* Bucket of powdered lime

---

# 6. Plant shrubs

* Bamboo
* Chaenomeles spp.
* Mahonia spp.
* Phormium spp.
* Rosa rugosa

# 7. Establish ground cover

1. Spread bark or wood chip* mulch
2. Plant ground cover
3. Sow temporary cover

![Bark mulch, Vinca minor and Sinapis alba temporary ground cover](img/groundcover.jpg)

???

* *See [Myths, Miracles or Marketing? Wood Chip Mulch](https://puyallup.wsu.edu/lcs/) on [Horticultural Myths](https://puyallup.wsu.edu/lcs/) by Professor Linda Chalker-Scott
* Mark out shrubs with bamboo, write name, height x diameter
* Bark approx 1.5 tonne per 100m². [Newbridge Sawmills](http://www.jamesdaviessawmills.co.uk/) near Cenarth sells it for £38.50 +VAT per tonne, on industrial trailer only, weekdays.
* For large areas (ie acres), consider wood chipper for mulch & flail mower to keep grass down. 
* I have used [Sinapis alba](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Sinapis+alba) (white mustard) with great success, partially overwinters.
* I bulk bought 27kg Sinapis alba from [Cotswold Seeds](https://www.cotswoldseeds.com/product/mustard-sinapis-alba) for £50.
